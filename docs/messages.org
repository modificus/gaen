* Entity/Component initialization sequence
Several "special" messages are sent in sequence to Entities and components as they initialize.

** Entity is constructed
** Entity::activate() is called
*** Inserts entity into engine (Queued)
*** Sends #init_data__(Queued) to EntityBase
**** EntityBase sends #init_data__(Immediate) to EntityScript task
***** EntityScript task initializes Properties and Fields
***** For each Component in EntityScript
****** Creates component
****** Calls Entity::insertComponent
****** Sends Component #init_data__(Immediate)
******* Component initializes Properties and Fields
****** EntityScript sends set_property messages to component for each property it is overriding
**** EntityBase Sends init_assets__(Immediate) to self
***** For each Component in Entity
****** Send Component #init_assets__(Immediate)
******* For each Asset declared in Component
******** Call Entity::requestAsset
********* EntityBase increments mAssetsRequested counter
********* #request_asset(Queued) is sent to HandleMgr
***** Send EntityScript #init_assets__(Immediate)
******* For each Asset declared in EntityScript
******** Call Entity::requestAsset
********* EntityBase increments mAssetsRequested counter
********* #request_asset(Queued) is sent to HandleMgr
***** If there were no assets at all (mAssetsRequested == 0)
****** EntityBase sends #init(Queued) to self
***** If there are assets (mAssetsRequested > 0)
****** Entity remains suspended, waiting for assets to be loaded
** HandleMgr
*** For each Asset that finishes loading, or is already pre loaded
**** HandleMgr sends #asset_ready__(Queued) to requesting EntityBase
***** EntityBase receives #asset_ready__(Queued)
****** If Handle is good, asset loaded
******* Find self or component that asset was intended for
******* Send asset_ready__(Immediate) to correct task
****** If Handle is bad, failed to load
******* EntityBase sends #fin(Queued) to self to destroy.
Failure to load an asset is considered fatal.
****** Increment mAssetsLoaded
******* If mAssetsLoaded == mAssetsRequested
******** EntityBase sends #init(Queued) to self
** EntityBase receives #init(Queued)
*** For each Component in Entity
**** Send Component #init(Immediate)
***** No special code here, just what the Script specifies for the Component if specified at all.
**** Send EntityScript #init(Immediate)
***** No special code here, just what the Script specifies for the Entity if specified at all.
*** EntityBase sends #set_task_status(Queued) with Running value to self
TaskMaster handles this message specially and sets the status flag on the Task.



* Standard Messages for Scripts
** #init
*** Called after Entity or Component is full loaded, immediately before it is set to start running in engine.
** #fin
*** Called when Entity or Component is being removed from the engine and about to be destroyed.
